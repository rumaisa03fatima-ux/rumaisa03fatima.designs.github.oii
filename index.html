     <h2>What I Learnt from these movies</h2>
      <p>
     Movies don’t just entertain—they can leave lessons that stay with you. These three films changed the way I look at life, the mind, and even morality.
     </p>
      <p>
     <strong>Dead Poets Society</strong> taught me the importance of living authentically. It reminded me that passion and individuality matter more than blindly following what society expects.
     </p>
      <p>
     <strong>Inception</strong> showed me the incredible power of ideas. It made me think about how deeply our beliefs shape the reality we live in, and how sometimes the mind can be its own prison.
     </p>
     <p>
     <strong>Se7en</strong> revealed the disturbing truth about human darkness. It forced me to see how fragile morality can be, and how even good people can be pulled into tragedy.
     </p>
     <p>
     Together, these movies gave me inspiration, curiosity, and caution—a strange mix that continues to shape how I think about life.
